# Text Editors
## Introduction
The original article guides the unexperienced developers/coders on how to chose their "text editor" written by -as his name spoil "the older programmer"- a much more experienced program; as he states, his choices of different text editors and what are the criteria too look for when choosing one.

## What to look for in a Text editor
the author suggests many criteria to look for; such as, completion its when the text editor suggests an auto-completion for your current element giving you the ability to code faster and extensions which is a helpful add-on that adds more functionality to your editor as you grow in programing you need an editor that grows with you so look for an editor with a great selection of extensions; the more catchy one for me was Emmet as it makes CSS and HTML coding more efficient which surely needed for a student of web development.
    
## IDE VS. Text editor 
Both of them are software used to write codes whoever an IDE is a beefed-up text editor, it gots everything that the editor had with an extra file manager compiler and debugger all in one package. 

# Summary
The author mentioned that he uses all the third-party editors that he suggested, assuring his initial point that the choice is a personal but also an educated one.
