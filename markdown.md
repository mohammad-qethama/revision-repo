## markdown and github 
markdown can be used around github following places:

1. Gists
1. comments in issues and pull requests
1. .md or .markdown files 

# Github flavoured markdown
git hub got his own version of markdown which got many more extra future , and it can be used with github pages to create websites without using HTML. 

## Some of github flavoured markdown commands 

***
__Here are some command that i found Interesting:__ 

 ### Syntax highlighting 
   * Which can be done to highlight codes by adding 4 spaces indentation before writing 

 ex:
     
     for i in lis1  
        print(lis1[x])
        x = x+1 
    print ('counter='+x)
***

* Tables
    * creating tables is easy in here following the next format"


```
First Header | Second Header
-------------| -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
 Content in the first column | Content in the second column 
```
**and there is the output with extra column :**

First Header | Second Header| extra header 
-------------| -------------|-------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2| extra content
 Content in the first column | Content in the second column | second column 

***Columns and rows can be added by lightly changing the syntax***

# Github pages 
A tool used to create pages using gethub repos creating url for it and giving some templates to render up your site, also you don't have to worry about server or data-base setup when you use it

## How does it work
it uses an URL that tied to your account on github to get web related content from you without changing your code
