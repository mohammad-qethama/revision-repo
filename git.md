# Introduction 
Git is a type of version control system (VCS) more specifically  a Distributed VSC (DVCS) which allow the usage of mirrored repositories preventing single point of failure. 

## Git working mechanism 
+ snapshots
   - created when `commit` called as it's taken  of the code and a reference for  it created

+ Local Operations
   + git relies  on local resources and local operations 

+ Tracking Changes
   + Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git

***
## Its useful! 
Git offers many functions beside tracking files like it does minimize the lost of data also it gives statues for the files.

Git on terminal had a set of commands that will help developers to get their jobs done like ACP , cloning and changes stashing : 

``` git stash ```
 
 `git clone [URL]`

`git add [file] `

`git commit -m "*"`

`git push origin main`
